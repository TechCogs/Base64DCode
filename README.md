# Base64DCode
A simple program to help you encode and decode data in base64.

When you want to encode and decode data in base64, there are websites that can help you do this. But why send your data to a website when you can do the encoding and decoding yourself? Base64DCode is an open source program that allows you to easily encode and decode data in Base64 on the command line.

The code has been tested on Linux 64-bit but it should work on any platform that supports compiling D programs and offers a command line interface. Compiling is simple: After making sure the D compiler is installed, just run "dmd -i -O -release Base64DCode.d".
